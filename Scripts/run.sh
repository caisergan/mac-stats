#
# Debug by default for fast iteration; --release uses release optimization,
# but does not notarize or install a shipping build.
#
# Signing modes:
#   (default)        Use a keychain identity when available, otherwise ad-hoc.
#   --adhoc          Ad-hoc (codesign -s -). Launches locally with no cert, but
#                    the ad-hoc signature has no certificate chain, so it cannot
#                    satisfy the app<->helper XPC code-signing pin
#                    (HelperConstants.peerRequirement, which requires
#                    `anchor apple generic` + the team OU). The privileged
#                    helper therefore stays unreachable and system / other-user
#                    processes (WindowServer, coreaudiod, root daemons) are NOT
#                    visible. Fine when you don't need elevated coverage.
#   --developer-id   Sign the helper and app with a real keychain identity so the
#                    XPC pin is satisfied and elevated coverage works. Uses
#                    $DEVELOPER_ID_APP if set, otherwise auto-picks the best
#                    available codesigning identity (Developer ID > Apple
#                    Distribution > Apple Development). An Apple Development cert
#                    (what `Xcode > Settings > Accounts` installs) is enough for
#                    local dev: it chains to Apple (`anchor apple generic`) and
#                    carries the team in subject.OU.
