"""Rename a localization key without losing its translations.

English source text is used as the key, which keeps call sites readable and
makes untranslated strings fall back to correct English. The cost of that
choice is that editing English copy would normally orphan every translation
attached to the old wording: at ten languages, changing one word silently
throws away ten translations.

This closes that gap. It renames the key in the String Catalog, carrying every
language across untouched, and rewrites the matching literal in the Swift
sources so the call sites and the catalog stay in step.

    Scripts/rename-localization-key.py "Refresh interval" "Update interval"
    Scripts/rename-localization-key.py --catalog-only "Old" "New"
    Scripts/rename-localization-key.py --dry-run "Old" "New"

After renaming, check the translations still read correctly: a reworded English
string sometimes needs its translations revisited, which is a judgement the
tool cannot make. Their state is left as it was so you can decide.
