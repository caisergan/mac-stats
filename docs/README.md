# Documentation

These guides describe Mac Performance Monitor 2.2 and the source on `main`.
Published packages and Homebrew follow public releases, not every source change.

## Product And Support

- [Project overview and screenshots](../README.md).

- [2.2 release notes](../RELEASE_NOTES.md) and [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md).

- [Energy](energy-design.md): card details, runtime forecasts, and battery history.

- [GPU](gpu-tab-design.md): bandwidth history, GPU awake, ANE Time, ANE Power,
  and the limits of each measurement.

- [Explorer](explorer-design.md): investigate recorded and live data at a chosen time.

- [Adaptive alerts](adaptive-alerts.md): growth rules, observations, snoozes,
  evidence, local state, and verification limits.

- [AI agents](ai-agents.md): connect Claude Code, Codex and other agents to the
  history through the bundled MCP server or `mpm`, and what they can read.

- [Display capture load](display-capture-load.md): the Insights advisory for
  concurrent capture-helper and display-service activity.

- [Security and privacy](../SECURITY.md): network access, permissions, exports,
  and private reporting.

- [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [translations](../TRANSLATING.md).

## Current Technical Guides

- [Dashboard chart standard](dashboard-chart-standard.md) applies to Dashboard
  and Explorer. It defines averages, recorded ranges, gaps, and source limits.

- [Memory taxonomy](memory-taxonomy.md) and [pressure index](pressure-index.md)
  explain the memory measurements.

- [Performance budget](performance-budget.md) records the monitoring cost goals.

- [Release checklist](release-checklist.md) separates local checks from signed
  upgrade testing and publication. [Homebrew](homebrew-submission.md) covers
  the distribution handoff.

## Preview And Plans

- [AI integration PRD](ai-integration-prd.md) describes the full target for
  Siri and on-device answers. Its [generative preview](ai-integration-prd.md#generative-preview)
  section records the opt-in implementation on main, its limits, and
  the checks still needed before a public release.

## Design History

Earlier design and investigation notes remain available for context. Their
dated observations, proposed work, and old names such as Analytics are not
current product guarantees. Prefer the guides above for shipped behavior.

- [App presence](app-presence-design.md), [temperature](temperature-design.md),
  and [Disk Map](disk-map-design.md).

- [Earlier chart policy](chart-rules.md), superseded for Dashboard and Explorer.

- [Pre-redesign alert audit](alerting-audit-2026-09-10.md) and the
  [history-cache crash investigation](persistence-cache-crash-2026-09-07.md).

- [Data-layer findings](data-layer-findings.md) and the
  [file-descriptor investigation](fd-count-1620-diagnosis.md).

- Efficiency reviews from [3 July](efficiency-analysis-2026-07-03.md),
  [9 July](efficiency-analysis-2026-07-09.md), and
  [22 August](efficiency-analysis-2026-08-22.md).

- [Onboarding design](onboarding-and-accessibility.md),
  [helper visibility](reference/HELPER_NOT_READABLE_INVESTIGATION.md), and
  [Endpoint Security research](reference/ESF_INVESTIGATION.md).
