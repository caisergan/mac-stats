# Temperature monitoring: sources and surfacing design

## GPU gaps: September 2026 follow-up

The Dashboard's short-range GPU line can have gaps while CPU data remains
present. Missing GPU readings are independent of CPU readings. A long-range
aggregate can contain a valid GPU maximum even when many raw readings were
missing, which makes the gap pattern less obvious at longer ranges.

The reader had a discovery defect: it kept only keys whose first value looked
like a valid temperature. A recognized GPU die key that initially returned
zero or no payload could be excluded for the rest of that reader's lifetime.

`SMCReader` now retains recognized CPU and GPU die candidates based on valid
type and size metadata. Each read still validates the actual value. Missing
domains and incomplete discovery retry at most once per five minutes. A
temporarily invalid value does not trigger a full rescan or erase a known key.
The reader also checks SMC result codes and response sizes, so a failed read
cannot become a successful zero-valued response.

This does not make every GPU reading available. Firmware can still return no
valid value. We neither substitute CPU temperature nor carry an old reading
across a failed sensor sweep. Existing missing history stays missing.

The Dashboard now preserves explicit missing rows through drawing and hover
selection. Temperature lines show temporal averages with known observed
bounds. Stored sensor-specific counts weight those averages. The previous
maximum-only temperature policy remains in other tabs until they migrate.
See [Dashboard chart standard](dashboard-chart-standard.md) for the full rules.

`SMCReaderTests` exercises discovery recovery, metadata errors, malformed
payloads, invalid readings, and the five-minute retry limit through an injected
transport. `DashboardChartTests` verifies independent GPU gaps and sensor
counts, including a check that a missing GPU span has no painted line pixels.
Hardware-dependent tests also exercise the live reader where SMC is available.

## Original research

Research notes from probing an M3 Pro (Mac15,6, macOS 26.6.2) with a standalone
tool that enumerated every readable temperature source. This doc records what is
available, what it costs to read, a bug the probe uncovered in the shipping die
temperature code, and a recommendation for where temperatures belong in the app
and menu bar.

## Sources inventory (all verified sudoless on macOS 26)

### 1. SMC keys (already shipping in `SMCReader`)

The AppleSMC user client exposes 2295 keys on this machine; 293 are readable
T* (temperature) or F* (fan) keys. Cost measured at ~119 us per key read with
key info cached, so a 40-key sweep is ~5 ms. Decoded map for the M3 Pro, by
prefix:

| Prefix | Meaning | Idle values seen |
|---|---|---|
| `Tp**` | P-core die sensors, per cluster (36 keys) | 38 to 53 C |
| `Te**` | E-core die sensors (13 keys) | 35 to 49 C |
| `Tg**` | GPU cluster die sensors (20 keys) | 34 to 41 C |
| `TB0T/TB1T/TB2T` | Battery (matches gas gauge readings) | 23.8 to 24.2 C |
| `TH0a/TH0b/TH0x` | SSD | ~27.7 C |
| `TaL*/TaR*` | Airflow left/right | 25 to 31 C |
| `Ts0P/Ts1P` | Skin/palm rest proximity | 22 to 23 C |
| `TW0P` | Wireless proximity | ~32 C |
| `TV**` | Voltage-rail/regulator sensors, NOT die | 0.01 to 59.1 C |
| `Ta0*` pairs | Calibration offsets (0.00 / -3.10), not real sensors | n/a |
| `Tz1*` | Unused zones, all 0 | n/a |
| `Tf**` | Mixed; includes offsets and two ~70 C outliers, treat as unknown | -4.5 to 75.5 C |

Fans: `FNum` reports 2 fans; `F0`/`F1` each expose actual RPM (`Ac`), target
(`Tg`), min (`Mn` = 2317), max (`Mx` = 6800), plus mode and state bytes. Both
fans were at 0 RPM at idle (fans-off is normal for M3 Pro under light load).
The shipping reader only reads fan 0.

Value types are `flt` (little-endian float) plus some `ioft` (64-bit fixed
point, divide by 65536); `ioft` shows up on `TG0*` and `TR*` keys and the
shipping decoder does not handle it yet.

### 2. HID temperature services (new, SPI)

`IOHIDEventSystemClient` matched on PrimaryUsagePage 0xff00 / PrimaryUsage 5
returns 46 services with human-readable names: `PMU tdie1..10` (SoC die),
`PMU tdev1..8` (board), `NAND CH0 temp` (SSD), `gas gauge battery` (x6), and
`PMU tcal` (calibration reference at ~52 C, not a display value). Most appear
twice (two PMU instances); dedupe by name.

Cost measured at ~974 us per read (a mach round trip to hidd per event), about
8x the SMC path. These are SPI symbols (`IOHIDEventSystemClientCreate` and
friends): fine for our Developer ID distribution (iStat Menus, Stats, and Hot
all ship it), not App Store safe, no root or entitlement needed.

Verdict: use SMC for the recurring sample loop (cheaper, one code path we
already ship). HID's value is naming and cross-checking; worth keeping in the
probe tool, not worth a second runtime dependency for the same numbers.

### 3. Thermal pressure (public API, free)

`ProcessInfo.processInfo.thermalState` (nominal/fair/serious/critical) plus the
`thermalStateDidChangeNotification`. Push-based, zero polling cost, public API.
This is the "is macOS actually throttling" signal that raw temperatures cannot
give, and we currently do not read it anywhere.

### 4. Already shipping elsewhere

Battery temperature (`BatterySample.temperatureCelsius`), NVMe SMART composite
temperature (Disk tab), and the GPU tab's die temperature and fan RPM from
`SMCReader`.

### 5. Not viable

`powermetrics` needs root. IOReport (which we already use for GPU P-states and
power) exposes no usable temperature channels. There is no public per-sensor
API.

### Root helper: not needed, deliberately

The probe read every sensor unprivileged (293 of 293 SMC T/F keys, all HID
services); Apple leaves SMC reads open. The only root-gated tool,
`powermetrics --samplers thermal`, reports just the pressure level on Apple
silicon, a strictly worse version of the free `ProcessInfo.thermalState`. The
one root-only capability nearby is SMC writes (fan control); that is a
different product, and adding an SMC-write selector to the helper would turn a
narrow read-mostly surface into a hardware-safety attack surface. Out of
scope, on purpose. Temperature joins the GPU tab in the "full coverage, no
helper needed" story.

## Bug found: the shipping die temperature is not the die

`SMCReader.discoverKeys()` accepts prefixes `Tp`/`Te`/`TV` and caps discovery
at 12 keys. SMC enumerates keys in sorted order, and uppercase sorts before
lowercase, so every `TV*` key is seen before any `Te*` or `Tp*` key. On the
M3 Pro, 12 `TV*` voltage-rail sensors pass the plausibility filter (10 to
110 C), so the cap fills entirely with them: the reported "die temperature" is
an average of voltage-rail sensors (including two ~59 C regulator readings and
an 18 C outlier), roughly 33 C at idle while the real die sensors read 38 to
53 C. It tracks load only incidentally. On earlier chips with fewer `TV*` keys
the average may have included real die sensors, which is why it looked sane.
Fix regardless of the rest of this doc: drop `TV` from the accepted prefixes,
raise the cap, and prefer max over average (users read "CPU temp" as "hottest
core", and max is what iStat and Stats report).

## Metric definitions (proposed)

- **CPU die**: max of `Tp*` and `Te*` after sanity filters (drop <=10 C,
  >=110 C). Keep the average as a secondary stat.
- **GPU die**: max of `Tg*` (`flt` keys only; the `TG0*` `ioft` keys are
  battery-adjacent readings, note the case). Replaces "GPU shares the die
  average" with the GPU's own sensors.
- **SSD**: max of `TH0*`, alongside the existing SMART composite.
- **Battery**: max of `TB0T/TB1T/TB2T` (agrees with the gas gauge, and we
  already surface battery temperature).
- **Fans**: per-fan actual/target/min/max for `FNum` fans, not just fan 0.
- **Thermal pressure**: the `ProcessInfo` state, observed push-based.

Discovery stays pattern-based (prefix plus sanity filter), never a hardcoded
per-chip key table: key names shift between M1/M2/M3/M4 generations but the
prefixes have held. Filters must reject the 0.00/-3.10 offset pairs and dead
zones. Validate on the M2 Pro before release.

## Cost budget

Sampling set of roughly 75 keys (36 Tp + 13 Te + 20 Tg + 3 TB + 3 TH plus both
fans) is ~9 ms per sweep at 119 us/key; at the existing 2 s throttle that is
~0.4% of one core, and a 5 s cadence drops it under 0.2%. Temperatures move
slowly; 5 s is plenty. Discovery is one enumeration, already the shipping
pattern. Thermal state is push. Net: no measurable budget impact.

## Where to surface it

In order of recommendation:

1. **Fix the GPU tab numbers first** (the `TV*` bug plus real `Tg*` GPU
   sensors and both fans). The tab already has the layout; the numbers become
   honest.
2. **Menu bar: a new Temperature metric** in the combined item
   (`MenuBarMetric.temperature`). Headline: CPU die max, colored by thermal
   pressure state (green nominal, orange serious, red critical), so color
   means "macOS is throttling", not an arbitrary degree threshold. Detail
   panel: CPU/GPU/SSD/battery rows with sparklines, per-fan RPM, and the
   current thermal pressure state. Temperature in the menu bar is the single
   most-requested reason people install iStat or Stats; this is the headline
   feature of the work.
3. **Energy tab: a Thermals section.** Heat belongs with power. Die
   temperature history chart (CPU and GPU series), fan RPM history, and a
   thermal pressure event log. The Dashboard stays memory-first; do not add a
   temperature tile there.
4. **History**: persist a compact row at the logging cadence: CPU die max/avg,
   GPU max, SSD, battery, fan RPMs, thermal state. Enables "when did it start
   running hot" questions, which no competitor answers well. Two rules:
   downsampling must preserve max as well as avg (a plain average erases the
   spikes, which are the point), and granularity stays per-domain, not
   per-sensor (the within-domain spread is a couple of degrees; the per-sensor
   long tail is the Hardware tab's live view, not history).
5. **Insights/alerts**: log thermal pressure transitions like pressure events;
   quiet-by-default alert on sustained serious/critical (mirrors the sustained
   swap alert). A throttling event with the top CPU process attached is the
   actionable version of "my fans are loud".
6. **Hardware tab**: a Sensors group in the inventory tree listing every named
   sensor with its reading at Refresh time (on-demand fits that tab's model).
   This is where the long tail (airflow, skin, wireless) lives, keeping the
   headline surfaces to the six meaningful numbers.

## Phasing

1. **PR 1, correctness:** fix the `TV*` discovery bug in `SMCReader` (drop the
   `TV` prefix, raise the 12-key cap, report max alongside avg), read both
   fans, decode `ioft`. Makes the shipping GPU tab numbers honest.
2. **PR 2, the thermal pipeline:** a domain-based thermal reader (CPU/GPU/SSD/
   battery/fans/pressure state), `v14-thermal` migration with max-preserving
   downsample, and the Energy tab Thermals section (history charts plus the
   thermal pressure event log).
3. **PR 3, menu bar:** the Temperature metric in the combined item, colored by
   thermal pressure state, with the detail panel.
4. **Phase two:** system series in Analytics (Analytics today is per-process
   only, so this means teaching it a system-series concept, real scope), the
   sustained-throttling alert with top CPU process attached, and the
   fan-vs-temp drift observation ("fans work harder for the same temperature
   than N months ago", the dust signal).

## Open questions

- `Tf*` and `TCMb/TCMz` run hot (67 to 76 C at idle) and are undocumented;
  exclude until identified.
- M4/M5 prefix drift: the probe tool (scratchpad, `temp-probe/probe.swift`)
  should be run on new hardware as it arrives; consider promoting it to a
  `--probe-sensors` flag on macperfmonitor-cli so users can contribute dumps.
- Menu bar width: a temperature readout adds to an already configurable item;
  the existing metric picker handles opt-in, no new mechanism needed.
