# Mac Performance Monitor

[![CI](https://github.com/Zesty0wl/mac-performance-monitor/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Zesty0wl/mac-performance-monitor/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A native macOS **performance analyzer and logger** that lives in your menu bar. It
continuously records CPU, memory pressure, GPU, network, disk, battery, and per-process
usage to a local database, then helps you make sense of it: trends, leaks, pressure
events, and on-device diagnostics.

Free and open source. No telemetry. Every sample stays on your Mac.

## Features

- **Menu bar at a glance:** live memory pressure, memory used, CPU, GPU, network,
  disk, battery, temperature and raw sensor readouts, each in the widget shape you
  pick, in one compact item, a strip, or one draggable item apiece, with a shared
  detail panel.
- **Dashboard:** a plain-language verdict, headline tiles, the pressure timeline
  with selectable ranges, a memory breakdown, and a swap trend.
- **Process explorer:** a live, sortable, filterable table of every process, with a
  detail inspector for footprint, CPU, file descriptors, disk I/O, and Rosetta status
  over time.
- **Process groups:** group related apps and helpers into a stack and see its blended
  footprint as a share of the device.
- **History and logging:** configurable-resolution logging to a local SQLite store;
  top consumers over any window you pick.
- **Disk tab:** live throughput, IOPS, service latency, and utilization with
  history; per-device hardware identity; per-volume capacity bars grouped by
  APFS container with purgeable space; SMART health for the internal SSD; a
  boot-volume free-space trend; and top processes by attributed disk I/O.
- **GPU tab:** who is using the GPU on Apple silicon, per process, with no helper
  (the AGX driver's per-context accounting), plus device utilization, clock-state
  residency, GPU and Neural Engine power, memory, thermal limit and power cap, a
  breakdown by workload category, and recognition of AI runtimes (Ollama, llama.cpp,
  MLX, LM Studio, Core ML, Apple Intelligence) with the model they serve where the
  command line says; an optional sustained-high-GPU alert. The GPU menu bar
  dropdown lists the top GPU processes too.
- **Hardware tab:** this Mac's inventory as a searchable, browsable tree with a
  visual overview: a block diagram of the chip (CPU clusters, GPU cores, Neural
  Engine, unified memory), capacity bars, the displays to scale, battery health,
  and every bus and device `system_profiler` and the kernel report (USB,
  Thunderbolt, Bluetooth, audio, cameras, storage, network, Wi-Fi via CoreWLAN,
  Metal limits, instruction-set features, secure boot). Read on demand with a
  Refresh button, never on the sampling tick; copy any item or save a report.
- **Leak detection:** flags processes whose footprint climbs steadily, plus a log of
  pressure events over time.
- **Deep-dive diagnostics:** explains what a process is and whether its behavior is
  normal, using signed, updatable check packs.
- **Insights and alerts:** quiet-by-default notifications for critical pressure,
  sustained swap, per-process ceilings, and suspected leaks.

Disk throughput, service latency, SMART health, free space, and top I/O processes:

Disk Map: scan the startup disk, a volume or any folder and see what is using
the space as a treemap you can zoom into, coloured by kind, age or depth, with
Largest and Oldest views, a bar that reconciles the scan against the volume's
used space (purgeable, clones, folders macOS would not let it read), and Reveal
in Finder and Quick Look on every item. Byte-exact against `du`, a full 3 M-file
disk in about twenty seconds, and the last scan comes back instantly:

workloads picked out:

## Install

Download `MacPerformanceMonitor.pkg` from the [Releases](../../releases) page and
double-click it. It's Developer ID signed and notarized by Apple, so it installs and
launches without security warnings, and keeps itself up to date via Sparkle.

### Homebrew

```sh
brew tap zesty0wl/mac-performance-monitor https://github.com/Zesty0wl/mac-performance-monitor
brew install --cask zesty0wl/mac-performance-monitor/mac-performance-monitor
```

This installs the same signed, notarized pkg. A submission to the main
[homebrew-cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) repository is in
progress (see `docs/homebrew-submission.md`); once accepted, the tap step won't
be needed and `brew install --cask mac-performance-monitor` will just work.

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Zesty0wl/mac-performance-monitor.git
cd mac-performance-monitor
swift build
swift test
Scripts/run.sh
```

Requires macOS 15 (Sequoia) or later and a Swift 6 toolchain (Xcode 16 or a Swift.org
toolchain), on Apple silicon.

## Privacy

No telemetry, no analytics, no phone-home. Every sample is written to a local SQLite
database and never leaves your Mac. Being open source, anyone can audit exactly what
it does.
