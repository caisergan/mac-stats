/// A compact toolbar control (present on every tab) that sets the GLOBAL refresh
/// interval: how often the live charts and the process rows on screen update.
/// Slower intervals lower CPU use sharply (the default is a deliberately light
/// 10 s). The full per-process scan, the table order, rankings and alerts keep a
/// 5 s floor (`LiveRefreshCadence.fullProcessInterval`); the rows on screen are
/// re-read at the dial rate in between.
///
/// The menu-bar read-outs are the exception: a subsecond setting speeds them up
/// with everything else, but a slower one does not slow them down, because the
/// system sample behind them is taken every second whatever the dial says (see
/// `SamplerModel.menuBarTick`). Throttling the bar below that bought no sampling
/// saving and only showed stale figures.
///
/// Backed by the shared `tableIntervalKey`, so it stays in lockstep with the same
/// setting in Settings, and the app applies any change through its
/// `UserDefaults.didChangeNotification` wiring. It reads only `@AppStorage`, not
/// the sampler, so placing it in the window toolbar does not re-render the tab
/// host on every sample.
