/// icon flashes on the way up. From there the policy follows the windows.

/// Any window the user can see makes the app regular. That is what gives it the
/// application menu and Command-Q, and the Edit and Window menus that a
/// window-first app needs; an accessory app has none of them, which is why
/// opening Settings from the menu bar used to need a manual activate to come to
/// the front. Closing the last window drops the app back to accessory, so
/// nothing sits in the Dock while it is only recording history in the
/// background.
///
/// One preference pins the regular policy for people who want the app in the
/// Dock permanently. It is off by default and keeps the old `showDockIcon` key,
/// because the old meaning, "also show a Dock icon while running", is exactly
/// the case the pin now covers.
