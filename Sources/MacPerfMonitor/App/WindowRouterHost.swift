/// An off-screen, always-present home for `MenuBarWindowRouter`.
///
/// SwiftUI's `openWindow` and `openSettings` actions only exist inside a mounted
/// view. They used to be carried by a one-pixel hosting view inside the status
/// item's button, which meant every window-opening path in the app depended on
/// the menu bar item existing: the reopen handler, notification clicks, a
/// `.mpmtrace` opened from Finder, the menu commands and the onboarding request
/// all queue in `WindowOpenBridge` until a router registers. That is fine while
/// the item is mandatory and fatal once it is optional, because with no item
/// there is no router, the queue never drains, and nothing can open a window
/// again for the rest of the session.
///
/// So the router moves here instead. This owns a one-pixel borderless window
/// parked far off-screen with zero alpha. It has to be ordered in, because a
/// hosting view in a window that was never ordered in does not mount and so
/// never registers, but it is invisible, ignores mouse events, stays out of the
/// Windows menu and out of window cycling, and refuses to become key or main.
/// That last part is what `NSWindow.isRealAppWindow` keys off, so presence and
/// lifetime logic can tell this apart from a window the user can see.
